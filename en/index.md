_Gramps_ allows you to manage a genealogy database.
The first contact with _Gramps_ is often difficult, because the designers made different choices from other programs, for example on the "individual" sheet, we cannot directly enter the date of birth \(we have to create a birth Type event\).
On the other hand, the choice was made to manage only the essentials in the software itself: the input and display of data. All other features are managed into plugins, of which there are many, but only a few of which are installed by default. Here again it can be confusing because some features that may seem essential are not present by default \(but where is the SOSA?\).  
Once these first hurdles are overcome, you will be able to take full advantage of the qualities of _Gramps_, for example:
* the power of the filters
* the richness of the grafts
* the clipboard
* the ability to put notes almost anywhere
* good management of sources
* and many others...
