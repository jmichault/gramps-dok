Before entering Gramps, it is important to understand how the data is organized.  

# The family universe

The three essential objects that will allow you to build your tree are:
* the individual:   
The basis of your genealogy.   
  an event consists mainly of type, date \(or pèriodo\), and description.

# The universe of sources
Source your genealogy is essential for its validation.   
  This is the best element of sources, the one that will be referenced by the individual, the family, the event, the place, the audio visual.   
* the source:  

  The source is the environment from which you extract your quotes.   
  The deposit allows you to group the sources.   
  Source can be found in several deposits. 

# Annexed objects
Finally four objects to enrich your data:
* The audio visual:  
   allows you to integrate a file into the tree.   
   We will be able to link it to individuals, families, events, quotes or places.   
   Very useful!   
  You can put tags on each object.   
  Label is a short text with which color is associated.
